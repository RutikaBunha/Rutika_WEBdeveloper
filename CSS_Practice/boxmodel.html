    <h2>DEMONSTRATING THE BOX MODEL</h2>
    <P>
        1 Strontium : Strontium is a silvery metal which is found naturally in the earth crust and it
        is a non-radioactive element .
        Strontium (Sr) is available in calcareous rocks and ocean water in trace amount [ ].
        It is found in food an
        d prevent bone loss /osteoporosis.

        Trace element that is found in calcareous rocks and ocean water. It is also a natural component of food and
        beverages.
        Sr is utilized to increase the bone volume or to prevent the bone loss. So, it is used popularly in treatment of
        osteoporosis. It is mostly found in skeleton and bone extra cellular fluid .
        Several different forms of strontium are used as medicine. The most common form of strontium is strontium
        chloride is found in dietary supplements. strontium burns in air with a bright red flame which causes its’
        applicability in fireworks.
        Strontium gives off hydrogen gas and strontium hydroxide during reaction with water.
        Natural strontium is paramagnetic, it had FCC crystal structure, 22.5 µm thermal expansion, 132 nΩ-m electrical
        resistivity, 35.4 W / (m.k) conductivity, 15.7GPa young modulus, 6.03 shear modulus, 0.28 GPa Poission ratio and
        1.5mohs hardness.
        It has melting point 1050 K, boiling point 1650 K and density 2.64 g/cm3 . Heat of fusion of strontium is 7.43
        kJ/mol and Heat of vaporization is 141 kJ / mol [ ] .
